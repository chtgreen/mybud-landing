## 🎯 What Makes This Special

### 1. **Voice Demo is Interactive**
Unlike most landing pages with static demos, this one actually responds to user interaction. Users can press and hold to "record" and see the full flow including AI processing animation.

### 2. **Timeline is Scrollable**
The plant lifecycle timeline isn't just an image - it's a real scrollable component with hover effects, making it engaging and memorable.

### 3. **Real Activity Feed**
The activity feed looks exactly like the real app with color-coded borders, entity badges, and realistic data. It's not a mockup screenshot - it's built with the same design patterns.

### 4. **iPhone Mockups**
Every screenshot is now wrapped in an iPhone frame, making it immediately recognizable as a mobile app and adding polish.

### 5. **Gradient Backgrounds**
Instead of flat colors, every section uses subtle gradients with organic bubble effects, creating depth and visual interest.
