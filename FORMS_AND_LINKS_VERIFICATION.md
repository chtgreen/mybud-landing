### 4. ⚠️ App Store Links (Intentional Placeholder)
**Component**: `src/react-app/components/ComingSoon.tsx`  
**Status**: ⚠️ **PLACEHOLDER** (This is intentional - app not yet published)

**Current Behavior**:
- Links have `href="#"` (placeholder)
- Only track interest via PostHog analytics (`app_store_interest`)
- Don't redirect to actual app stores

**Reason**: 
The mybud app is currently in closed beta and has not been published to the App Store or Google Play yet.

**Future Action Required**:
When the app is published to app stores, update these URLs in `ComingSoon.tsx`:

```tsx
// iOS App Store (around line 26)
<a
  href="https://apps.apple.com/app/mybud/YOUR_APP_ID"  // Update with actual App ID
  onClick={() => trackAppStoreInterest('ios')}
  ...>

// Google Play Store (around line 44)
<a
  href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.mybud.app"  // Update with actual package ID
  onClick={() => trackAppStoreInterest('android')}
  ...>
```
